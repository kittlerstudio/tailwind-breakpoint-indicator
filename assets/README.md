# Assets for README

Add a screenshot of the breakpoint indicator here:

- **Filename:** `screenshot.png`
- **Suggested content:** Screenshot of the indicator in the browser (e.g. one breakpoint visible in the top-left corner).

The image will be shown in the main README and on the npm package page.

**Note:** In `package.json`, set the `repository` URL to your GitHub repo (e.g. `"url": "https://github.com/username/tool-tailwind-breakpoint-indicator"`) so that npm can resolve the relative image path when displaying the README.
